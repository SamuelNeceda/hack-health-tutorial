# Server

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    If you encounter the issue when starting the server or client side of the application saying: "Port *portNumber* is
    already in use", run the following commands in the terminal:
    ```bash copy
    sudo netstat -tulpn | grep *portNumber*
    sudo kill *PID*
    ```
    Replace the *portNumber* with the port number you are trying to use and *PID* with the process ID obtained from the
    first command.
