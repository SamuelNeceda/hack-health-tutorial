## Intro
In case of need, check out to the branch called `2_routes`. This branch has already implemented the code for the server.

## Register route
1. Create a new folder called `routes` on the same level as `database-scripts` folder.
2. Inside the `routes` folder, create a new file called `jwtAuth.ts`.
3. In the `index.ts` file, add the following code after `// ROUTES`:
```js filename="index.ts" copy showLineNumbers
// ROUTES
app.use("/auth", require("./routes/jwtAuth"));
```
It means that if you hit the `/auth` route, it will go to the `jwtAuth.ts` file. <br />
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Now, we are going to build the register route step by step and the whole code will be presented at the end of this section. The basic idea is that in the final app, the user will enter the values to the form and the form will be sent in the POST request to the `/register` endpoint in JSON format. Then, it will be evaluated and if everything is ok, the user will be inserted into the database and authorized.
</Callout>

When the JSON from the client side is received, we need to destructure it and get the values from the request body. <br />
```js filename="index.ts" copy showLineNumbers
import {Router} from "express";

const router = Router();
// Define the register endpoint route and associated handler function
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => {

    // Destructure the req.body object to get user input values
    const {
        email,
        password,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        title,
        birthdate,
        phone,
        sex,
        status,
        birthnumber,
    } = req.body;
}

module.exports = router;
```

Then, in the highlighted try-catch block, we are going to query the database to check if the user already has a record in the database. <br />
If the user is already registered, we will send an error message.


```js filename="index.ts" copy showLineNumbers {22-31}
import {Router} from "express";
import pool from "../dbServer";

const router = Router();

// REGISTER
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
    const {
        email,
        password,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        title,
        birthdate,
        phone,
        sex,
        status,
        birthnumber,
    } = req.body;

    try {
        const user = await pool.query(
            "SELECT * FROM useraccount WHERE email = $1",
            [email]
        );

        if (user.rows.length) {
            return res.status(401).json("User is already registered.");
        }
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

In the next and **final section**, we are going to insert the user into the database, return the response or throw an error when something during an execution goes wrong.

```js filename="index.ts" copy showLineNumbers {32-55}
import {Router} from "express";
import pool from "../dbServer";

const router = Router();

// REGISTER
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
    const {
        email,
        password,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        title,
        birthdate,
        phone,
        sex,
        status,
        birthnumber,
    } = req.body;

    try {
        const user = await pool.query(
            "SELECT * FROM useraccount WHERE email = $1",
            [email]
        );

        if (user.rows.length) {
            return res.status(401).json("User is already registered.");
        }

        const insertStatus = status ?? "patient"
        let uniqueUser = await pool.query(
            "INSERT INTO useraccount (email, password, firstname, lastname, title, birthdate, phone, sex, status, birthnumber) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10) RETURNING *",
            [
                email,
                password,
                firstname,
                lastname,
                title,
                birthdate,
                phone,
                sex,
                insertStatus,
                birthnumber,
            ]
        );

        res.json({
            success: true,
        });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
        res.status(500).send("Server error");
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Connection to database 
When we want to make queries to the database, we also need to define the logic in the `dbServer.ts` file located in the same hierarchy as `index.ts` file
```js filename="dbServer.ts" copy
// Configure connection to database

import {Pool} from 'pg';


const pool = new Pool({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    user: "postgres",
    password: "postgres",
    database: "hackhealthdb",
})

export default pool;
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Now, start the server by running `npm run dev` and open Postman by running `Postman` in the terminal of the virtual machine. You can try a predefined request to `register` endpoint. <br />
    As a result, you should get status code **200** and **"success": true**
</Callout>

## Login route
**The implementation of the `login` route is very analogous to the `register` route.**
The login route accepts a **POST request** to the `/login` endpoint and expects the email and password properties in the request body. <br />
The route first queries the useraccount table for a user with the provided email address. If no user is found, the route returns an error. If a user is found, the route compares the provided password with the stored password. If the passwords match, the route returns a success message indicating that authentication was successful. <br />

Paste the following code into the `jwtAuth.ts` file. <br />
```js filename="jwtAuth.ts" copy showLineNumbers
// LOGIN
router.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
    const {email, password} = req.body;

    try {
        const user = await pool.query(
            "SELECT * FROM useraccount WHERE email = $1",
            [email]
        );

        if (user.rows.length === 0) {
            return res.status(401).json("Invalid email.");
        }

        const validPassword = password === user.rows[0].password;

        if (!validPassword) {
            return res.status(401).json("Invalid password.");
        }

        res.json({
            success: true,
            message: "Authentication successful!",
        });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
        res.status(500).send("Server error");
    }
});
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Similarly, as `register` route, you can test `login` route using a predefined request in Postman. You can try to log in with the email and password of the user you have just registered. <br />
    As a result, you should get status code **200** and JSON object with **"success": true** and **"message": "Authentication successful!"**
</Callout>

## Dashboard route
As the last route in this lecture, we are going to implement the dashboard route. <br />
In the `index.ts` file, add the following line in the `// ROUTES` section. <br />
```js filename="index.ts" copy showLineNumbers
app.use("/dashboard", require("./routes/dashboard"));
```

Then, create a new file `dashboard.ts` in the `routes` folder and paste the following code.
```js filename="dashboard.ts" copy showLineNumbers
const router = require("express").Router();
import pool from "../dbServer"

router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // req.user -> returns the object with id which represents userid in table
    const user = await pool.query(
      "SELECT firstname FROM useraccount WHERE password = $1",
      [req.user.password]
    );

    res.json(user.rows[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    res.status(500).send("Server error");
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The route handler queries a PostgreSQL database using the pool object to select the firstname column from the useraccount table where the password column matches the password of the authenticated user. The req.user object is expected to contain an id property that represents the ID of the authenticated user in the table.
<br />
If the query is successful, the route handler sends a JSON response containing the firstname of the user as the body of the response. The res.json method sends a JSON response to the client and automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header in the response.
<br />
The router object is exported from the module so that it can be mounted to the appropriate URL path in the main application file using the app.use method.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Middleware will be added to this implementation to make it fully functional, so we will not test it in this lecture.
</Callout>

## Summary
In this lecture, we have learned how to implement the authentication routes in the Node.js application. In the next section, we will have a closer look at the JWT authentication and we will adjust our current implementation accordingly.
