## Introduction
For this part, we are going to work with following [repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/hackhealth/web_app). Every lecture in this part represents a separate branch in the repository. You can just simply follow the instructions in the lecture to create the app, but if you get lost or stuck with an error, you can always check out to the branch with the same name as the lecture and see the code there. <br />

## Tech stack

We are going to build a web app using the popular **PERN** stack. <br />
**PERN** stands for:
* PostgreSQL
* Express
* React
* Node

The project will be running only locally because we want to keep it as separate as possible because of future cybersecurity attacks.
Monorepo will be divided into 2 parts:
* **server-side** (BE) - Express server with PostgreSQL database handling all the requests from the client side
* **client-side** (FE) - React app with Bootstrap styling and Axios for handling requests to the server side

## Sources
Implementation of the app was inspired by the following sources:
