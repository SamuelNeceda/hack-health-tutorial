## Introduction
For this part, we are going to work with this [repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/hackhealth/web_app). Every lecture in this part represents a separate branch in the repository. You can just simply follow the instructions in the lecture to create the app, but if you get lost or stuck with an error, you can always check out the branch with the same name as the lecture and see the code there. <br />

## Tech stack

We are going to build a web app using popular **PERN** stack. <br />
**PERN** stands for:
* PostgreSQL
* Express
* React
* Node

The project will be running only locally, because we want to keep it as separate as possible because of the future cybersecurity attacks.
Monorepo will be divided into 2 parts:
* **server side** (BE) - Express server with PostgreSQL database handling all the requests from the client side
* **client side** (FE) - React app with Bootstrap styling and Axios for handling requests to the server side
