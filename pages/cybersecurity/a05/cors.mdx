## About
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested
from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
To put in simple words, when a web browser tries to access resources on a different domain, it sends an HTTP request
to the server hosting the resource. If the server does not allow requests from that domain, the browser will block
the response and the web application will not be able to access the resource.

## Demo
1. In the `jwtAuth.ts` file, comment out the line `app.use(cors());{:js}` in `server.ts` file and try to log in to the HackHealth account.
2. As you can see, the login is not successful and if we open in browser the Developer Tools (Ctrl + Shift + I) -> Console, we get the message like:
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/auth/verify' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS
    policy:
    Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
    on the requested resource...
</Callout>

When setting up web server, we included cors library and added the following line of code:
`app.use(cors());{:js}`
This action was deliberately left uncommented in the tutorial, because it is meant to show one important thing.
Even experienced software engineers sometimes just copy some parts of code and are generally not fully aware of the
consequences it can have on the application and its security.

    Now, uncomment the line `app.use(cors());{:js}` and try to log in to the HackHealth account again.
</Callout>

Your login should be successful.

## Prevention
We are developing everything locally, so we do not have to be aware of the risks of CORS attacks. However, when we deploy
our application to the production environment, we should be aware of the security risks and take appropriate measurements.
You should always define the origins of the requests that are allowed to access your API.

1. Add the following variable to the file `jwtAuth.ts`.
```js filename="jwtAuth.ts" copy showLineNumbers
const options = {
   origin: 'http://localhost:3001'}
```

2. Pass the options object to the cors function.
`app.use(cors(options));{:js}`

By doing so, we are allowing only requests from the origin `http://localhost:3001` to access our API.
All other requests will be blocked by the CORS policy.
