# Burp Suite

## About
Burp or Burp Suite is a set of tools used for penetration testing of web applications. It aims to be an all in one set of tools and its capabilities can be enhanced by installing add-ons.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the free community version, but for more advanced features, you can purchase the professional version.
During the course of this tutorial, we will be using tools:
* Proxy
* Intruder

**Proxy** is an intercepting proxy which gives us a power to see and modify the contents of the requests
and responses while they are in transit. <br />
**Intruder** is a tool which allows us to perform automated attacks on web applications. It allows us to
brute-force on login forms, dictionary attacks on fields suspected for being vulnerable to XSS or SQL injection, ...

## Setting up
1. Open burpsuite app (Community edition is preinstalled on Kali Linux)
2. Create Temporary project
3. For the configuration, keep "Use Burp defaults" checked and click "Start Burp"
4. New project is created and Burp Suite is ready to use

## Proxy
1. Go to the proxy tab in the top menu. Intercept should be set to off.

2. CLick on the "Open browser" button in the top right corner. <br/>
    This will open a new browser window with Burp Suite as a proxy. <br/>
    You can also use your favourite browser and set the proxy to Burp Suite, but it required some additional configuration.
3. Go to the website you want to test. In our case: http://localhost:3001/ <br/>
    (the app (server and client) should be obviously running)
4. Turn the Intercept on. <br/>
    Now, every request and response will be intercepted by Burp Suite.
5. In the HackHealt app, click on "Login" button
6. In the Burp Suite, in the HTTP history tab, you can see all requests and responses made. <br/>
7. Try to login with correct credentials. <br/>
    After hitting the "Login" button, nothing really happens in HackHealt app. <br/>
    In Burp Suite, in Intercept tab, you can see that the request was intercepted. <br/>
    You can see all the details and by pressing "Forward" button (2 times), you can send the request to the server and dashboard appears.
<br/>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    You have successfully intercepted a request and seen, how much information we were able to get from it. You can play a little more with a **Proxy** tool, but we will use it later on (and also with **Intruder** tool)
