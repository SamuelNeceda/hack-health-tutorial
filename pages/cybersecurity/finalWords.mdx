* Try to bear in mind the security concepts you have learned and apply them in your future projects.
* Try to use the tools you have learned to test your own projects.
* Let it be a first step in your journey about constant learning and improving your skills also in cybersecurity, even if it is not your main focus.

## Community
If you are passionate about this topic, you can look at the concept of [OWASP Local Chapter](https://owasp.org/chapters/). 

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    In Slovakia, there is not an active OWASP Local Chapter. For those of you who are passionate about cybersecurity and would like to be part of a community like that, it is a great opportunity for you to create an initiative to start one. Good luck!
