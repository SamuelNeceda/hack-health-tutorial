# JWT Authentication

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🔍">
  **CWE-256**: Plaintext Storage of a Password <br />
    It has implications in other categories, such as the previous "A1 Broken Access Control" if the attacker can use the obtained credentials to gain unauthorized access to the system.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Our application is using JWT authentication. This means that the user is authenticated by a token that is sent with
    every request. The token is signed with a secret key that is only known to the server and is stored in the local
    storage.
    Even though JWT is a popular mechanism (but still not the most secure one) for authentication and session
    management in web applications,
    some vulnerabilities can be exploited if not configured properly. <br/>
    **BONUS**: If you want to learn more about JWT, visit its [official website](https://jwt.io/).

## Password stored as plain text

Storing a password as plain text was never a good idea and in a world where we can hash the password in one line of
code, there is no reason to do it.

### Register
1. Navigate to ```jwtAuth.ts``` file.
2. In the method handling the post request to register route, uncomment the lines after 3rd step.
```js filename="jwtAuth.ts"  copy showLineNumbers
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
const bcryptPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
```
3. Replace the parameter `password` with `bcryptPassword` in the query.

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Those adjustments will hash the password before storing it in the database when the user is registered.
</Callout>

### Login
1. In the method handling the post request to login route, uncomment the
line: `const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.rows[0].password);{:js}`
2. Remove the line `const validPassword = password === user.rows[0].password;{:js}`
3. By this change, the password will be hashed before comparing it with the password stored in the database.

## JWT token

1. In the source code, navigate to `jwtGenerator` method definition in `jwtGenerator.ts` file. <br />
The method generates a token using the payload object and a secret key defined in a .env file.
2. Make sure that field in the payload object is unique to the user and cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. <br />
In our case, we used the user`s password hash, which is a good practice.

### Expiration

Currently, the token is valid for 1 hour. When logged in to the application in some shared device (coffee shop, library, etc.) and the user forgets to log out, the token will be valid for the remaining time. <br />
Set the expiration time to a shorter period (e.g. 5-15 minutes) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. <br />
`return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "15m" });{:js}` <br />
After the expiration time, the user will be logged out and will have to log in again. <br />

<Callout emoji="💡">
    There are some more complex and sophisticated ways to handle this issue, but for this tutorial, we
    will
    keep only the expiration time.
</Callout>


### Secret key

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The secret key is stored in the .env file. The key is used to sign the token and is only known to the server.
    it should be kept secret to prevent unauthorized parties from creating or modifying tokens. If the key is weak or
    easily
    guessable, an attacker can use it to sign their own JWT tokens, impersonate legitimate users, or modify the payload
    of
    existing tokens.
</Callout>


In `.env` file (server/.env), replace the `JWT_SECRET` value with strong password (use password [genetator](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator))

**There are two more things to consider:**
1. The secret key should be stored in a secure location. In our case, it is stored in the .env file using the dotenv
library. Also, as the app is
not deployed and just running locally, we do not have to explicitly check if the .env file can be accessed publicly.
2. Last but not least, the secret key should be changed periodically by implementing secret rotation.
