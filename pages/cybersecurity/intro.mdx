# Introduction

Welcome to the most interesting part of the tutorial. Get ready for:
* getting familiar with the all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
* learning how to exploit them in the HackHealth app
* learning how to fix and prevent them

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    In the tutorial you will be introduced to techniques for hacking a web application. Please note that this tutorial is for educational purposes only and all actions are performed in an isolated environment and in a purposefully insecure application that is designed for this purpose.<br />

## OWASP Top 10
Lectures are based on the [OWASP Top 10:2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). It is the most up-to-date publication of the OWASP Top 10, which is a well-known list of the most critical web application security risks. It is published approximately every 3-4 years by the [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) (Open Web Application Security Project).
It is a great resource for developers, security professionals, and anyone involved in web application development. <br />

OWASP is not only about the Top 10 list. It is a community of people who are passionate about web application security. They are constantly working on new projects and tools.

## CWE
In the very beginning of each lecture, you will find a number of the [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) (Common Weakness Enumeration) that is related to the vulnerability. Each vulnerability listed in OWASP Top 10 has a list of CWEs that are related to it. CWE is the most comprehensive list of software weaknesses containing more than 1,000 entries.
