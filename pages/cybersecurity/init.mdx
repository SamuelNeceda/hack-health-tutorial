## Install dependencies
1. In the terminal, navigate to the **client** directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. After it is completed, do the same for the **server** directory.

## Initialize Database
For the database, we are using PostgreSQL. <br />
The database server is already running on the VM, so we are just going to create the database and seed it with some data. <br />

### Create a database

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-create
```

### Create tables and insert data

Run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-seed
```

### Drop database

If you corrupt the database and data in it during exposing the vulnerabilities, you can drop the database and create it
again.
Run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-drop
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
In case of need, to recreate the database, tables, and records, run `npm run db-create` and `npm run db-seed` commands.
</Callout>

### [Optional] Interact with the database

<Callout emoji="💡">
    1. To interact with the PostgreSQL database server, you can use `psql` CLI.
    * You can type SQL commands to interact with the database, and it also provides meta-commands to interact with the
    server.
    2. Second option is to use preinstalled GUI tool called DBeaver, but we strongly recommend using `psql` CLI.
    A tutorial for these two tools is not part of this tutorial, but there are many available online.

## Run the Application
1. In the terminal, navigate to the server directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server.
2. In another terminal, navigate to the client directory and run `npm start` to start the client.
3. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` and familiarize yourself with the application.
