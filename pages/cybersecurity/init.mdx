## Clone the repository
Follow all instructions in the [üêôRepository](/initialSetup/repository), but choose the 2. [repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/hackhealth/cybersecurity). <br />
If you completed the "Web App Setup" chapter, you can just directly clone the second repository, because you have already configured the SSH key. Implementation is slightly adjusted for this part, so you have to clone the second repository, even though you did the first part.

## Install dependencies
1. In the terminal, navigate to the **client** directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. After it is completed, do the same for the **server** directory.

## Initialize Database

For the database, we are using PostgreSQL. <br />
The database server is already running on the VM, so we are just going to create the database, tables and seed the tables with some data. <br />

**Before running following commands, terminate (CTRL + C) the running server in the terminal and insert the commands in the server directory** <br />

### Create a database

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-create
```

### Create tables and insert data

Run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-seed
```

### Drop database

If you corrupt the database and data in it during exposing the vulnerabilities, you can drop the database and create it
again.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
    Do not run this command now, because it will erase everything you just created.
</Callout>

```bash copy
npm run db-drop
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
In case of need, to recreate the database, tables, and records, run `npm run db-drop`, `npm run db-create` and `npm run db-seed` commands.
</Callout>

### [Optional] Interact with the database

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    1. To interact with the PostgreSQL database server, you can use `psql` CLI.
    * You can type SQL commands to interact with the database, and it also provides meta-commands to interact with the
    server.
    2. Second option is to use preinstalled GUI tool called DBeaver, but we strongly recommend using `psql` CLI.
    A tutorial for these two tools is not part of this tutorial, but there are many available online.

## Run the Application
1. In the terminal, navigate to the server directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server.
2. In another terminal, navigate to the client directory and run `npm start` to start the client.
3. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` and familiarize yourself with the application.
