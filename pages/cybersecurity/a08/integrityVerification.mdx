# Lack of integrity verification

  **CWE-494**: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
</Callout>

## About
**Software and Data Integrity Failures** can take many forms, particularly since as the web evolves it is more and more common to use third-party code and services within web applications. These failures can be summarised as follows:
* Usage of code that does not verify the integrity of the source
* Usage of third-party plugins where you do not control the source
* Plugins and extensions from untrusted sources
* The introduction of or potential for compromise or unauthorized access
* Auto-updates assume the trust of the source

In this lecture, we will focus on the last point, which is **auto-update of packages**.

## Demo
Auto-update of packages is easy to implement, often with good intentions, but can be a source of compromise. Auto update of packages can be done by installing a package:
```bash copy
npm -g install npm-check-updates
```
and then running the following command in the terminal:
```bash copy
ncu -u
```
The last command will update all the packages in the `package.json` file to the latest version.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The vulnerability is, that the auto-update of packages is made without sufficient integrity verification. As long as repositories are open-source, an attacker can upload its version of the package which is then distributed and run on all installations where the automatic update is enabled. 
</Callout>

## Prevention
* **It is not a good practice to use auto-update of packages.** Instead, you should use a package manager that allows you to specify the version of the package you want to install.
* As was already mentioned in [A06 - Vulnerable packages](/cybersecurity/a06/vulPackages), you should only use libraries and packages from trusted sources.
* Also, you should always use a static code analyzer (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check), which also checks for known vulnerabilities in the packages you use.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This is not a bulletproof prevention, because in this type of attack, attackers rely on the fact that no security scanner will detect the vulnerability of the package right after the installation of a new compromised version and it will give them enough time to compromise the system before being detected.
