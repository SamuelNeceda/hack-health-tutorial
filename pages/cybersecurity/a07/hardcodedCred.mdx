# Use of Hard-coded Credentials

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🔍">
  **CWE-798**: Improper Restriction of Authentication Attempts
</Callout>

## About
Securing sensitive data or credentials like:
* API credentials
* Session Secret Key
* DB Connection Credentials
* Security Tokens
is a very important task for any application. If the credentials are not secured properly, then the attacker can easily access the sensitive data and misuse them.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    One common way how to handle this is by using **environment variables**. Environment variables are present outside the application and reside in the Operating System or container of the application where the application is deployed. Besides storing sensitive information, they can provide different configurations for different environments (dev, stage, prod, etc.)
</Callout>

## Demo
1. In the root directory, run:
```bash copy
snyk code test
```
Among the results, you should see also a medium severity vulnerability: `Use of Hardcoded Credentials`.

2. We will use environment variables from `.env` file.
3. It should already contain following values:
 ```bash filename=".env" copy showLineNumbers
# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=hackhealthdb
```

4. In the file `dbServer.ts`, replace the hardcoded credentials with environment variables: <br />
**It is already implemented in `dbCreate.ts`, `dbDrop.ts` and `dbSeed.ts`**

<Callout emoji="💡">
    To read the environment variable from .env file, we are using a parser from `dotenv` package. It loads the environment variables from the .env file into the process.env object. We can access any environment variable using process.env.[ENV_VARIABLE_NAME].
</Callout>

**Final implementation of `dbServer.ts`:**
```typescript filename="dbServer.ts" copy showLineNumbers
// Configure connection to database

import {Pool} from 'pg';


const pool = new Pool({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: process.env.DB_PORT,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DB_NAME,
})

export default pool;
```

5. After replacing the credentials with environment variables in affected file, this vulnerability should be gone after running `snyk code test` again.

## Prevention
Credentials should never be hard-coded in the application. One of the practices is to use environment variables. Other ways to prevent this vulnerability are:
* Use of a credential manager
* Use of a key management system
* Use of a password vault

In real-world applications, it is recommended to use the methods mentioned above rather than environment variables.

<Callout emoji="💡">
    When using environment variables, `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to the repository. We will not do it in this demo, because you are working with your local copy of the repository.
