# Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**CWE-798**

## About
Securing the sensitive data or credentials like:
* API credentials
* Session Secret Key
* DB Connection Credentials
* Security Tokens
is a very important task for any application. If the credentials are not secured properly, then the attacker can easily access the sensitive data and misuse them.

One common way how to handle this is by using environment variables. The credentials are stored in the environment variables and are accessed by the application. This way the credentials are not hard-coded in the app.

## Demo
1. In the root directory, run
```bash copy
snyk code test
```
Among the results, you should see also medium severity vulnerability: `Use of Hardcoded Credentials`.

2. We will move all hardcoded credential into `.env` file as environment variables.
3. In the `src/server/.env`, insert the following:
 ```bash filename=".env" copy showLineNumbers
# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=hackhealthdb
```

4. In following files, replace the hardcoded credentials with environment variables: <br />
**Files:**
    * dbCreate.ts
    * dbDrop.ts
    * dbSeed.ts
    * dbServer.ts

**Example for dbDrop.ts:**
```typescript filename="dbDrop.ts" copy showLineNumbers
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const { Client } = require('pg');

dotenv.config();

const client = new Client({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: process.env.DB_PORT,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD
});

// rest of the code ...
```

5. After replacing the credentials with environment variables, this vulnerability should be gone.
