# A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Vulnerable and outdated components is on 6th position on the OWASP Top 10 2021 list.
It is a common problem with (in many cases) easy to fix solutions. Developers are often not aware of
vulnerabilities it can rise and how severe they can be.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Some of you maybe remember the Log4J vulnerability, which originated in December 2021. The vulnerability affects the
    Log4j library, which is a popular open-source logging library used in many Java applications, including web
    applications and enterprise systems. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on a
    vulnerable server by exploiting a feature in Log4j that allows users to embed expressions inside log messages.
    The severity of the vulnerability led to urgent fixes. Even in the company I work for, at that time, it was the
    highest priority task and was taken care of in a matter of hours to not risk any breaches which could have been
    caused by this vulnerability.
