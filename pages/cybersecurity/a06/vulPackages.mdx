# A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

# Vulnerable Packages

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🔍">
  **CWE-1035**: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
</Callout>

## About 
We will use **Snyk static tool analysis** to detect packages with known vulnerabilities. If the fix is provided in another version
of the package, we will update the package version. In the case when the package is not maintained or the vulnerability cannot be fixed just by updating the package, we will look for and implement a proper solution.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Vulnerable packages were detected at the time of preparing this part of the tutorial (19.3.2022). In the future, more vulnerabilities will be
    detected in used packages, which only highlights the importance of regular scanning of your project.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="💡">
    You will often encounter packages that are introduced by other packages. If the parent package does not provide
    an updated version with a fixed child package, you have to track down the child package and change the version manually.
</Callout>

## Client side
Navigate to the client directory and run:
```bash copy
snyk test
```
Among all packages, `nth-check` and `webpack` packages introduced through `react-scripts` have a vulnerability.
Luckily, the fix is provided for both of them.

### nth-check package
<br />
<Image src="/a06/nth-check.png" alt="nth-check package" width={1000} height={300}/>
<Callout emoji="💡">
    1. In the whole project, replace the version of `nth-check` from 1.0.2 to 2.0.1.<br/>
    2. Run `npm install` to install the new version of `nth-check`.<br/>
    3. After running `snyk test` again, the `nth-check` vulnerability should be fixed.
</Callout>

### webpack package

Try to resolve this vulnerability by yourself. Just follow the same steps as for `nth-check` package, but update the version of `webpack` from 5.75.0 to 5.76.0.

## Server side
Navigate to the server directory and run:
```bash copy
snyk test
```
There are two packages with known vulnerabilities: `underscore` and `express-brute`.
We will start with `underscore`.

### underscore package
<br />
<Image src="/a06/underscore.png" alt="underscore package" width={1000} height={300}/>
<Callout emoji="💡">
    1. In the whole project, replace the version of `underscore` from 1.8.3 to 1.13.6.<br/>
    2. Run `npm install` to install the new version of `underscore`.<br/>
    3. After running `snyk test` again, this vulnerability should be fixed.
</Callout>

### express-brute package
The second vulnerability on the server side is identified as `express-brute`. This package is used to prevent brute-force attacks.
All versions of `express-brute` are vulnerable to **Rate Limiting Bypass** vulnerability.

#### Rate Limiting Bypass
Rate-limiting bypass is a type of attack that allows an attacker to bypass rate-limiting protection if not implemented properly. It can be circumvented by using:
* proxy server
* IP address spoofing (IP rotation)
* using specific headers in a request
* appending "null byte" to the end of targeted fields

<Callout emoji="💡">
    The alternative package for `express-brute` is `express-rate-limit`. It is more popular and has no known
    vulnerabilities.
    In this tutorial, we will not replace the implementation of middleware, but you can try it yourself and verify if
    the replacement works as expected without any vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

## Which package to use?
You may be asking, how to determine which package to use to perform specific tasks. Yeah, sometimes you are happy that the particular package even exists that you do not have to code it yourself, and that you find it quickly.
But, when you want to make your software product secure and reliable, make sure to follow the checklist below:

<Callout emoji="💡">
    You can pick any of your personal/school projects and try to apply the checklist below. If the check is fulfilled, you can **mark it as done** by clicking the checkbox on the left of the description.
</Callout>

<br />
<CheckBoxItem text="Check if the package is maintained." />
<CheckBoxItem text="Check the count of downloads per week." />
<CheckBoxItem text="Check the number of open issues and also stars on a GitHub repository." />

Now, we will illustratively compare `express-brute` and `express-rate-limit` packages based on the checklist above.

<Image src="/compare_packages.png" alt="Comparison of packages" width={1000} height={300}/>

<Callout emoji="💡">
    After comparison, it is pretty obvious which package to use...
</Callout>

## Challenge
As mentioned in the beginning, more vulnerable packages and their versions will be detected by the time of practicing this tutorial.
<Callout emoji="💡">
    As your personal challenge, based on the acquired knowledge, try to fix as many vulnerabilities as possible.
