# Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🔍">
  **CWE-209**: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
</Callout>

## About 
One of the most common, and on the other hand easily prevented vulnerabilities related to Insecure design is the generation of error messages containing sensitive information. This vulnerability is related to the fact that the application generates error messages that contain some kind of information, which can be used as a hint for an attacker to execute a more serious attack. It can have many forms and severities, we will demonstrate one of them in this example.

## Demo
In the login screen of the web app, enter the valid username and invalid password. What message is displayed in error notification?

```
Invalid password.
```

Now, enter the invalid username and valid/invalid password. The notification being displayed is:
```
Invalid username.
```

Both error messages indicate whether a user exists or not. It relates to a weakness in the authentication mechanism where an attacker can obtain information about the validity of the username or password by observing the system's response to invalid login attempts.
Therefore, it's essential to provide generic error messages to users when authentication fails to prevent such attacks.

## Prevention
In the source code, navigate to the file `jwtAuth.ts` and based on the displayed error messages, change the error messages to generic ones.
