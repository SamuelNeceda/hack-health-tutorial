# Introduction

Welcome to the HackHealth tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the processes of building a simple web application called HackHealth. The app will then serve as a playground for exposing cybersecurity vulnerabilities and you will also learn how to handle them.

## Tutorial Structure
The tutorial is divided into 3 parts:

#### - Part 1: Initial setup
To be able to run the application, you will need to install some tools and set up the environment. This part will guide you through the process.

#### - Part 2: Web App Setup [OPTIONAL]
In this part, we will go through the main stages of building a simple web application.
This part is optional, but if you would like to learn or revise up-to-date practices for building web applications, you are welcome to follow it.
Additionally, it will give you a better understanding of the code for the next part, where you will be looking for vulnerabilities and fixing them.

#### - Part 3: Application security
This is the most interesting part of the tutorial.<br/>
Here, you will first learn about the specific vulnerability type. Then, you will have a chance to actually hack the application and witness the vulnerability in action. Finally, you will learn how to fix the vulnerability directly in the code to prevent it from happening again.

## The goal

1. Create a simple web application
2. Expose vulnerabilities in the application
3. Fix the vulnerabilities and be aware of potential risks in the future
