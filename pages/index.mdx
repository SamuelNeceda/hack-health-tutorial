# Introduction

Welcome to the HackHealth tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the processes of building a simple web application called HackHealth. The app will then serve as playground for exposing cybersecurity vulnerabilities and you will also learn how to handle them.

## Tutorial Structure
Tutorial is divided into 3 parts:

#### - Part 1: Initial setup
To be able to run the application, you will need to install some tools and set up the environment. This part will guide you through the process.

#### - Part 2: Web App Setup [OPTIONAL]
In this part, we will go through main stages of building simple web application.
This part is optional, but if you would like to learn or revise up to date practices of building web applications, you are welcome to follow it.
Additionally, it will give you better understanding of code for the next part, where you will be looking for vulnerabilities and fixing them.

#### - Part 3: Application security
This is the most interesting part of the tutorial.<br/>
In here, you will firstly learn about the specific vulnerability type. Then, you will have a chance to actually hack the application and witness the vulnerability in action. Finally, you will learn how to fix the vulnerability directly in the code to prevent it from happening again.
