# Repository

## Choose repository

There are two repositories available for you.
Open them in web browser inside VM.

1. [repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/kpi-zp/2023/bp.samuel.neceda/hackHealth) contains all steps from creating the vulnerable web app, to executing attacks and fixing the
vulnerabilities. // TODO: add proper link
2. [repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/kpi-zp/2023/bp.samuel.neceda/hackHealth) contains final version of the vulnerable web app, in which you can expose the vulnerabilities and fix
them afterwards. // TODO: add proper link
 * By doing so, you will skip the process of creating the vulnerable web app, and you will focus on the process of
identifying and fixing the vulnerabilities.
 * When using this option, jump directly after this lecture to lecture [üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCybersecurity](/cybersecurity/a01).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
    It is strongly recommended to use the [first
    repository](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/kpi-zp/2023/bp.samuel.neceda/hackHealth), because you will learn how to
    create the vulnerable web app from
    scratch, and it will
    help you with identifying the vulnerabilities.

## Clone repository

1. Fork the repository to create your own copy in your personal/university GitLab account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    You are more than welcome to contribute to the repository.
    If you find any mistake, or you want to improve the tutorial, you can create a merge request to the original
    repository.
    It will be reviewed and merged if valid, or the maintainer will request the changes.
</Callout>

## Version control

For version control, you can use preinstalled GitHub Desktop or git CLI supported inside IDE of your choice.

## IDE set up

1. Open the cloned repository in an IDE
    * Visual Studio Code and WebStorm are preinstalled on VM, but you can use any other IDE you prefer.
    * For the purpose of this tutorial, WebStorm will be used as demonstration IDE.
2. When using WebStorm, make sure to log in to your JetBrains free students account to get access to all features.
3. You can also import your predefined settings from your JetBrains account.

## Install dependencies

1. In the IDE, open the terminal.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## First walkaround...

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  What you can see is a skeleton of the web app, which is not yet functional.
Some part are already implemented, some are missing and the others are commented out.
Your task is to implement the missing parts and uncomment the commented out parts by following the tutorial.
Let's get started!
