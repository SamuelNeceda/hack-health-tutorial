# Repository

Choose a repository management platform that is more convenient for you. You can use either GitHub or GitLab. Github is presented by default, but you can switch to GitLab by clicking on the GitLab tab.

    ## GitHub
There are two repositories available for you.
Open them in the web browser inside VM.

1. [repository](https://github.com/SamuelNeceda/web_app) contains all the necessary steps for creating a simple monorepo web app using **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). You will learn how to create the vulnerable web app from scratch, and it will help you with identifying the vulnerabilities later on. For your convenience, individual lectures have a corresponding branch in the repository, so even if you miss some parts, you can always catch up.
2. [repository](https://github.com/SamuelNeceda/cybersecurity) contains the final version of the vulnerable web app, in which you can expose the vulnerabilities and fix them afterward.

    It is strongly recommended to start with the 1. [
    repository](https://github.com/SamuelNeceda/web_app), because you will learn how to
    create the vulnerable web app from
    scratch, and it will
    help you with identifying the vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity section. If you want to skip the first part and jump directly to the cybersecurity section, you can jump directly after this lecture to lecture [üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCybersecurity](/cybersecurity/codeAnalysis).

### Clone repository
1. Open the terminal in the VM 
2. Create a folder to store your project: `mkdir HackHealth`
3. Go to the folder: `cd HackHealth`
4. Clone the repository to the VM, to the folder called `HackHealth` you created in the previous step. Use the following command:
```bash copy
git clone "repository url"
```
5. After the clone is finished, after running `ls` command, you should see the repository folder in the `HackHealth` folder.
<Callout emoji="üí°">
    You are more than welcome to contribute to the repository.
    If you find any mistakes, or you want to improve the tutorial, you can create a merge request to the original
    repository.
    It will be reviewed and merged if valid, or the maintainer will request the changes.

    ## GitLab
### Connect to GitLab
In the next steps, you will need to clone a repository from GitLab. To do so, you firstly need to connect to your GitLab account from a VM:
1. Open the terminal in the VM 
2. Create a folder to store your project: `mkdir HackHealth`
3. Go to the folder: `cd HackHealth`
4. Run the following command and press enter to accept the default values
<Callout emoji="üí°">
    When pasting the command into the terminal, use Ctrl + Shift + V shortcut to paste the command without formatting.
</Callout>
```bash copy
ssh-keygen
```
5. Run the following command and copy the output
```bash copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
6. Go to [GitLab](https://git.kpi.fei.tuke.sk) and log in
7. Go to your profile settings ("Preferences")
8. Go to SSH Keys
9. Insert the copied key into the "Key" field and set expiration to be the next day (for enhanced security)
10. Click "Add key"
11. Back in the terminal, run the following commands:
```bash copy
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
```bash copy
git config --global user.email "your.email@student.tuke.sk"
```

### Fork and Clone repository

1. Fork the repository to create your own copy in your university GitLab account.
2. Clone the repository to the VM, to the folder called `HackHealth` you created in the previous step. Use the following command:
```bash copy
git clone "repository url"
```
3. Type `yes` to the prompt and press enter.
4. After the clone is finished, after running `ls` command, you should see the repository folder in the `HackHealth` folder.

## Version control

For version control, you can use preinstalled GitHub Desktop or git CLI supported inside the IDE of your choice.

## IDE set up

1. Open the cloned repository in an IDE
    * Visual Studio Code and WebStorm are preinstalled on the VM
        * **VS Code** - you can log in to your account to sync all your preferred settings
        * **WebStorm** - you can log in to your JetBrains free students account to get access to all features
        * you can use **any other IDE** you prefer (but in this case, you will have to install it)
    * For the purpose of this tutorial, WebStorm will be used as a demonstration IDE.
2. When using WebStorm, make sure to log in to your JetBrains free student account to get access to all features.
3. You can also import your predefined settings from your JetBrains account.
