# Database

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use PostgreSQL database.

## PostgreSQL server

Verify that PostgreSQL server is running locally on your VM.
Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo service postgresql status
```

or

```bash
pgrep -u postgres -fa -- -D
```

When the server is running, you should get positive response from either of the commands above.

### PostgreSQL server not running

Insert following lines step by step into the terminal:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
sudo service postgresql start
```

Verify that the server is running.

## Create database

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db-create
```

## Create tables and insert data

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run db-seed
```

## Drop database

If you corrupt the database and data in it during exposing the vulnerabilities, you can drop the database and create it
again.
Run the following command:

```bash
npm run db-drop
```

To recreate the database, tables and records, run `npm run db-create` and `npm run db-seed` commands.

## [Optional] Interact with database

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
1. To interact with PostgreSQL database server, you can use `psql` CLI.
    * You can type SQL commands to interact with database, and it also provides meta-commands to interact with the
      server.
2. Second option is to use preinstalled GUI tool called DBeaver, but we strongly recommend to use `psql` CLI.
   Tutorial for these two tools is not part of this tutorial, but there are many available online.
