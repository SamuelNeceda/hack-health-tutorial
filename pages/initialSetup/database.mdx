# Database

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the PostgreSQL database.

## PostgreSQL server

The PostgreSQL server is confirmed to start automatically when the VM is started, but you can verify that it is running by running the following command in the terminal:

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    When pasting the command into the terminal, use CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste the command without formatting.
</Callout>

```bash copy
sudo service postgresql status
```

or

```bash copy
pgrep -u postgres -fa -- -D
```

When the server is running, you should get a positive response from either of the commands above.

### PostgreSQL server not running

Insert the following lines step by step into the terminal:

```bash copy
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
sudo service postgresql start
```

Verify that the server is running.

## Create a database

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-create
```

## Create tables and insert data

Run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-seed
```

## Drop database

If you corrupt the database and data in it during exposing the vulnerabilities, you can drop the database and create it
again.
Run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run db-drop
```

To recreate the database, tables, and records, run `npm run db-create` and `npm run db-seed` commands.

## [Optional] Interact with the database

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    1. To interact with the PostgreSQL database server, you can use `psql` CLI.
    * You can type SQL commands to interact with the database, and it also provides meta-commands to interact with the
    server.
    2. Second option is to use preinstalled GUI tool called DBeaver, but we strongly recommend using `psql` CLI.
    A tutorial for these two tools is not part of this tutorial, but there are many available online.
