# First things first

Before launching deliberately vulnerable web app in Virtual Machine, you need to install and configure some tools. This tutorial will guide you through the process.
1. Make sure you have Oracle VM VirtualBox installed on your machine (version 6.1.40 or higher)
        * If not, download it from the page:  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Make sure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS
    * When running Widows, you can check it in the Task Manager -> Performance -> CPU
    * When running Linux, you can check it in the System Information -> CPU
    * When running Mac, you can check it in the System Information -> Hardware -> Overview
      If virtualization is not enabled, you can use many online tutorials to enable it.
