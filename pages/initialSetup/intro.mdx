# First things first

### Security on a first place
Later on, in a course, we will realize cybersecurity attacks on a deliberately vulnerable web application. Because of it, we are going to set a completely isolated environment from the device you are using and also from the network.

### Before installing the VM
For this purpose, we are going to use Virtual Machine (VM). Before moving to the next section:

1. Make sure you have **Oracle VM VirtualBox** installed on your machine (version 6.1.40 or higher)
    * If not, download it from the [page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Make sure **virtualization** is enabled in your BIOS

    When running Windows, you can check it in the `Task Manager -> Performance -> CPU`

    When running Linux, you can check it in the `System Information -> CPU`

    When running Mac, you can check it in the `System Information -> Hardware -> Overview`

If virtualization is not enabled, you can use many online tutorials to enable it.
